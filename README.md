# 🚀 GPU-Accelerated Deep Learning Model Training

This repository contains an end-to-end PyTorch implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, comparing training performance between **CPU and GPU environments**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to benchmark the difference in performance (training time and accuracy) when training a deep learning model on **CPU** versus **GPU**. The CNN model is trained for **image classification** on CIFAR-10.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Simple CNN model using PyTorch
- Image classification using CIFAR-10 dataset
- Training & evaluation on both **CPU and GPU**
- Performance benchmarking (time + accuracy)
- Easy-to-read code structure for beginners

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔹 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GPU-Accelerated-CNN.git
cd GPU-Accelerated-CNN
```

### 🔹 Install Dependencies

We recommend creating a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔹 Run the Code

```bash
python cnn_cifar10_benchmark.py
```

> 📌 The script will automatically detect and use the available GPU (if `torch.cuda.is_available()` is True), otherwise it defaults to CPU.

The model is a simple CNN with:

* 2 Convolution layers
* 2 Max Pooling layers
* 3 Fully Connected (Dense) layers
* ReLU activations
* Softmax output via CrossEntropyLoss
